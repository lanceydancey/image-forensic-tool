# Image Processing Tool

## 11/20/23

- Created this readme, yep, probably should have had this going the whole time

- Today I am working on reading the json file that contains objects that have the name, date, gps attributes. I am going to recreate image data objects and use those to drop map markers onto the map. im just going to try to get them on there, and then I will worry about chronological order.
