To run the game, simply do a cargo run. You will be prompted to enter a board size. This should be two ints in this format 'r c'. Row then column with a space in between. The board will generate and display. Turns are taken using the same format. Leave the upper left square for you opponent to eat to win!

What I struggled with: Writing the AI algorithm was by far the hardest part. I think that after reading it a couple times I thought that I understood it, but I didn't really until I started to dig into it. There was just enough going on in it that I couldnt hold it all in my head at one time, so I had to start tinkering, and it took a good bit of tinkering. 

Struggles cont'd: I think the funniest thing that happened was that I was having an off by one error when I took in a use move. I was convinced that only the column was off by one, and I couldnt figure it out, it didnt make any sense. But then I got some extra eyes on it, and both row and column were off by one and it was a super easy fix. go figure. 

More struggles: I think I struggled over all syntactly with the language. Heretofore I don't think that we had been asked to do too much, and I had kind of skated by a little bit. But I definitely got some practice in on this one. Taking stuff in from the user is always a pain. I glossed over the hint about the prompted crate before it was too late and I didn't feel like refactoring soemthing that was working. 

That being said, the game works, which is a huge win.
